# Academic Schedule Generator

A Java application that generates a conflict-free academic schedule and selects the best possible option based on student preferences.

## Overview
This project helps students automatically build class schedules by validating time constraints and resolving conflicts between course sections. When multiple valid schedules exist, the system evaluates them internally and returns the most efficient option for the student.

The user always sees a single finalized schedule; alternative schedules are evaluated internally and never exposed.

## Key Features
- Time conflict detection between course sections
- Validation of academic constraints (credit limits, time bounds)
- Internal optimization to prefer more efficient schedules
- Modular, object-oriented design
- Console output and HTML calendar export

## How It Works (High Level)
1. The system generates all valid combinations of course sections.
2. Invalid schedules are rejected due to time conflicts or constraints.
3. When more than one valid schedule exists, the system scores them internally based on efficiency factors (such as fewer days on campus).
4. The highest-scoring schedule is selected and presented to the user.

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming
- JUnit (logic verification)

## Purpose
This project demonstrates structured problem-solving, clean system design, and the ability to implement decision logic that scales as problem complexity increases.
